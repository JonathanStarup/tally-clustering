# Tally Clustering
An exploration of computational complexity in tally clustering.


# Introduction
How do you keep a running count of things in writing? It might be about keeping
track of how many rounds you've knitted, how many cups of office coffee you've
had, or how many red cars have gone past.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks) has some information on
it and there's many ways to do it. The most common method I've seen is the one
where you count by adding vertical lines unless its a multiple of five, then you
add a horizontal or diagonal bar to cover the previous four.

Other methods listed on the Wikipedia page includes prettier systems but that are functionally the same, either clustering tallies in fives or tens.

Another approach is roman numerals...

Another approach is normal counting, written down. With this method you write the full number of the count at each update. This means that you don't use any of the existing writing on the paper. This means that it almost does count as a tally system but I'll include it anyway since its the way that computers count.
